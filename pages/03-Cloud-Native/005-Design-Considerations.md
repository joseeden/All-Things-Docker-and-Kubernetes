# Design Considerations

It is necessary to allocate time at the start to identifying the design factors ensure that the application will be built and maintained with minimal engineering effort.

1. **List all requirements**
    In this phase, we determine the following:
    - Stakeholders - *who will sponsor the project?*
    - Functionalities - *what functions should be included?*
    - End users - *For whom is this service?*
    - Input and Output Process - *What will be the flow?*
    - Engineering Teams - *Who are needed in doing the project?*


2. **List all available resources**
    Here we determine what is the context of implementing these functionalities.
    - Engineering resources - *Who can work on the project?*
    - Financial resources - *How much is the budget?*
    - Timeframes - *How soon do we want the project to finish?*
