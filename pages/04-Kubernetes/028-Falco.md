# Falco 



Falco helps you gain visibility into abnormal behavior, potential security threats, and compliance violations, contributing to comprehensive runtime security.

- Uses a rules engine to define security rules that specify what behaviors and activities should be considered anomalous or potentially malicious.
- Falco monitors system calls and can raise alerts based on unexpected or suspicious system call activity. 
- Falco can alert on unexpected file system or network activity.

While Falco is not primarily a static analysis tool, it excels in runtime security and anomaly detection. It can complement static analysis tools by providing continuous monitoring and alerting capabilities to detect and respond to security events in real-time.
