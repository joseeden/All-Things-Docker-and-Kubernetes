# Least Privilege Principle



The "Least Privilege" principle in Kubernetes, as in other security contexts, is a fundamental security concept that emphasizes restricting permissions and access rights to the minimum level necessary for a specific task or role.

- Limit Access to Nodes 
- Implement RBAC Access 
- Leverage Kubernetes namespaces for resource isolation.
- Remove Obsolete Packages and Services 
- Restrict Network Access
- Restrict Obsolete Kernel Modules 
- Identify and Fix Open Ports 
- Implement Pod Security Policies
- Prevent resource exhaustion and potential abuse
- Enable Kubernetes audit logging
- Conduct regular security audits and reviews

By adhering to the least privilege principle, Kubernetes administrators and developers can create a more secure and resilient environment, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential security vulnerabilities.
