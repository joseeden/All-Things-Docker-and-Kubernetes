# CNCF Projects   

**Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** is the open source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud native computing, hosting projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus to make cloud native universal and sustainable. 

CNCF manages different projects which extends the Kubernetes solution to provide more features. Here's some of the projects:

- **CRI-O** - A Kubernetes container runtime that manages the containers.

- **CNI** - pluggable common network interface

- **Jaeger** - an operator for packaging, deploying, and managing applications

- **Rook** - a storage orchestrator for Kubernetes 

Each of these projects will have different statuses as defined by CNCF.

- **Sandbox** - project is new and used by innovators only 
- **Incubating** - projects are slowly being adopted
- **Graduated** - project becomes a part of the K8s environment
