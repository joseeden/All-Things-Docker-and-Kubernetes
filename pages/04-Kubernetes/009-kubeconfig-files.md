# Kubeconfig files and Statis Pod Manifests


## Kubeconfig 

A **kubeconfig** file is used to define how to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. TIt contains the following information:

- certificate information, for authentication 
- cluster location 

If you used **kubeadm** to setup Kubernetes, you'll see that it creates a collection of kubeconfig files which are stored in <code>/etc/kubernetes</code>.

Here are some files that kubeadm generates:

- **admin.conf** - configuration for the super admin account

- **kubelet.conf** - helps the kubelet locate the API server and present the correct client certificate

- **controller-manager.conf** - tells kubelet the API server location and the client certificate to use

- **scheduler.conf** - tells kubelet the API server location and the client certificate to use

## Static Pod Manifests 

A **Static Pod Manifest** describes the configuration of a Pod. These are **generated by the kubeadm init** for the cluster components that it needs to bootsrap:

- etcd 
- API server
- Controller anager
- Scheduler

The **kubelet** then monitors the manifests directory and starts up Pods that are described in those manifests.

This enables the core cluster components to start without the cluster

These statis pod manifests are stored in <code>/etc/kubrnetes/manifests</code>
