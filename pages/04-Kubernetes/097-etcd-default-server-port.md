# etcd Default Server Port 

The official etcd ports are **2379** for client requests and **2380** for peer communication. The etcd ports can be set to accept TLS traffic, non-TLS traffic, or both TLS and non-TLS traffic.

To start etcd automatically using custom settings at startup in Linux, using a systemd unit is highly recommended.
