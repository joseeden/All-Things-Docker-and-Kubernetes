# Scheduling Pods 

You can constrain a Pod so that it is restricted to run on particular node(s), or to prefer to run on particular nodes. The scheduling of Pods on nodes in a cluster can be controlled by using a few mechanisms.

- [DaemonSets](./010-DaemonSets.md) 
- [Taint and Tolerations](./022-Taints-and-tolerations.md)
- [Node Selectors](./023-NODESLSECTOR.MD)
- [Node Affinity](./023-NODESLSECTOR.MD)  
- [Pod Affinity](./024-Pod-affinity.md)

In addition to these, there are other concepts that we can use to influence the scheduling of Pods.

- [Container Resource Requirements](./025-Container-resource-requirements.md) 
- [Static Pods](./025-Container-resource-requirements.md) 
- [Custom Scheduling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/)
