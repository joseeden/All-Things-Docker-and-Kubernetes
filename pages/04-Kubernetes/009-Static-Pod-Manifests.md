# Static Pod Manifests 

A **Static Pod Manifest** describes the configuration of a Pod. These are **generated by the kubeadm init** for the cluster components that it needs to bootsrap:

- etcd 
- API server
- Controller anager
- Scheduler

The **kubelet** then monitors the manifests directory and starts up Pods that are described in those manifests.

This enables the core cluster components to start without the cluster

These static pod manifests are stored in <code>/etc/kubernetes/manifests</code>

## Static Pods 

Static pods are pods that are managed directly by the nodes kubelet and not through the Kubernetes' API server. This means that static pods are not scheduled by the Kubernetes scheduler and instead are always scheduled onto the node by the kubelet.
